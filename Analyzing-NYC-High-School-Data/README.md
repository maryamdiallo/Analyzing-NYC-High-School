# Project: Analyzing NYC High School Data

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test given to graduating high schoolers in the US every year. The SAT has 3 sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. The SAT is used by colleges to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.

New York City has published data on the SAT scores of students, along with additional demographic datasets.

New York City has a significant immigrant population, and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to figure out if the SAT is a fair test. If certain racial groups consistently performed better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair, for example.

## Context 
This project is part of Dataquest.io guided projects. Datasets were provided and we were asked to make data exploration in Jupyter Notebook. Each project were constituted of 6 to 8 steps of exploration, analysis, visualization and sometimes machine learning algorithm implementation. Additional steps were given at the end of each project to advance our exploration. The text cells between each code cells are part of the instructions that were provided. It is slightly retouched. For example, instead of 'you', it has been replace by 'we' to improve readability. 

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `analyzing_nyc_school_data.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory titanic_survival_exploration/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook analyzing_nyc_school_data.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook analyzing_nyc_school_data.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The datasets used in this project is included in the folder `schools`. This dataset is provided by [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io).
